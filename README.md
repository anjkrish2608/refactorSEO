# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This website provided by Trilogy Education Services has been refactored to increase web accessibility, increase code efficiency in the html and css and ensure function of links. To increase code efficiency in the html the tags were replaced with appropriate semantic tags. As a result this allowed the css style code to be streamlined due to the ability of using html tags as selectors. Where appropraite classes were utilised to allow general styles to be applied and IDs were applied for specific scenarios. The links are now all functioning appropriately.

Web accessibility should be at the forefront of all developers minds. It is a very important social injustice in our industry - the incredible internet and all of its uses are not accessible for everyone. The best way to create an accessible website is to **design** an accessible website, however in the siuation of refactoring an inaccessible website there are many changes that must be made. 

The first hurdle I encountered when trying to increase accessiblity was ensuring keyboard accessibility. To overcome this tabular indexes were added to certain elements. Throughout the html all tags were changed to be semantic and detailed alt attributes were added to each image or icon. To increase visibiity for the visually impaired the contrast of colours was checked and the font weight was increased. Appropriate headers were used for content and structured correctly When making these alterations the challenges I faced included getting the float right for the aside. Trying to reorder the tabular order for the unordered list items.

## Credits

Throughout creating this website to ensure the webcontent accessibility standards were met the website **webaim.org** was heaviliy consulted. In particular the keyboard techniques and the contrast checker were utilised.
